# SGL

0. Let no-one ignorant of geometry enter here.
1. Let no-one ignorant of algorithms enter here.

The library is in active development. Don't use it, because i will:
- use git push -f
- completely change contracts for some algorithms and contains
- all containers have bugs, and I'll rewrite them at some point.

# Code of conduct

# TODO: think about
- functors for SIMD instructions
- SIMD and 2D iterators
- Word hashing without collisions (also, save as many operations as possible) 
  - Obtain a vocabulary of all the words
  - ensure we can encode all the words and character-level ngrams without collisions


TODO:
- `sgl.v1.class.adaptive_hash.h`
- `sgl.v1.class.cuckoo_hash.h`
- `sgl.v1.class.lri_cache.h`
- `sgl.v1.class.lru_cache.h`
