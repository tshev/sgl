# SGL

0. Let no-one ignorant of geometry enter here.
1. Let no-one ignorant of algorithms enter here.

The library is in active development. Don't use it, because i will:
- use git push -f
- completely change contracts for some algorithms and contains
- all containers have bugs, and I'll rewrite them at some point.
